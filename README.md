# CIFAR-10 Classification using CNNs
In this Project, we use Convolutional Neural networks, also dubbed CNNs or ConvNets, to solve a Deep Learning classification problem on the CiFAR-10 Image Dataset.


## Project Overview

The core intent of this repository is to implement, test, and compare various deep learning techniques to understand how different architectural choices impact the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network. 

Throughout the project, we explore and compare the performance of:
* Standard ConvNets
* Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)
* Spatial Batch Normalization
* Kaiming Initializations
* Sandwich layers
* Fast layers

## Contents

All of the project files are located within the `src` directory:
* **`convolutional_networks.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the core implementations and performance comparisons.
* **`convolutional_networks.py`**: A python script containing the utility functions and helper code.
* **`filtering.ipynb`**: A simple notebook dedicated to learning and visualizing CNN concepts.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and run the models yourself, simply install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
